# SOC Phishing Alert Triage & Escalation Case Study

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Tier 1 Security Operations Center (SOC) response to a phishing alert involving a confirmed malicious email attachment. The case study focuses on alert evaluation, playbook-driven investigation, escalation decision-making, and professional ticket documentation.

The investigation represents the response phase of an incident lifecycle following prior confirmation that the attachment was malicious.

## Alert Summary
A phishing alert was generated after an employee received an email containing a suspicious executable attachment. The alert was classified as medium severity and indicated that the user may have opened the attachment. A known malicious SHA256 hash associated with the attachment was included in the alert details.

## Investigation Objectives
- Evaluate a phishing alert using SOC procedures
- Validate alert details and indicators of malicious activity
- Apply a phishing incident response playbook
- Determine whether the alert should be escalated or closed
- Document findings and response actions in a ticketing context

## Investigation Methodology
The alert was reviewed following the organization’s phishing incident response playbook. Investigation steps included evaluation of sender and message characteristics, confirmation of the malicious attachment using threat intelligence, and assessment of risk to the endpoint. Based on confirmed malware delivery, the alert was escalated in accordance with playbook guidance.

## Key Findings
- The email contained an executable attachment (`bfsvc.exe`)
- The attachment’s SHA256 hash was confirmed malicious
- The phishing email exhibited common social engineering indicators
- Malware delivery created risk of endpoint compromise
- Escalation was required based on playbook criteria

## Response Action
The alert ticket was escalated to a higher-tier SOC analyst for containment and remediation. The escalation decision was based on confirmed malicious content and the likelihood of endpoint compromise.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SOC alert triage and evaluation
- Playbook driven incident response
- Phishing analysis and malware validation
- Threat intelligence usage
- Incident escalation decision making
- Professional ticket documentation

## Deliverables
- SOC phishing alert triage and escalation report (PDF)
- Final alert ticket comments documenting investigation and response
